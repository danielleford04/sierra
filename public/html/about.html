			<h2>About Sierra Retreats</h2>
			<p>Sierra Retreats is a Colorado non-profit corporation dedicated to making the dharma (Buddhist teachings) available in Colorado&#39;s Front Range area. We have sponsored meditation retreats in the Vipassana or Insight Tradition since 1990 bringing highly respected Buddhist teachers from throughout the country to teach in gorgeous Colorado settings.</p>

			<h2>Dana</h2>
			<p>Dana is the practice of generosity. Your help in funding Sierra Retreats will primarily go toward providing partial scholarships to those who have difficulty paying the full cost of retreats. These are paid for through dana, or donations, provided by others. Many who have received assistance also give dana when they can afford to do so. Dana of any amount helps make the Dharma available to others and is greatly appreciated. Thank you!<br><br>
			Please note that Sierra Retreats is a Colorado Nonprofit Corporation but does not have an IRS Tax ID Number. Donations to Sierra Retreats may not be tax deductable.<br><br>
